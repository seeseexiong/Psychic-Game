# Psychic Game
This app is an interactive game that runs on the web browser.  

This is an alphabet letter guessing game.
The computer will think of a letter 'a' through 'z' and you will have to guess it correctly.
For each guess, use the keyboard to type the letter.
Each time you guess correctly you gets a point.
If you guess wrong 9 times, you lose a point.
Each time you win or lose a point, the computer will think of a new letter.

Enjoy!
