# Psychic-Game

Directions:
In this game, you have to guess what letter the computer is thinking about.
You can type any letter from 'a' through 'z'.
Each time you guess right you get a point.
If you guess wrong 9 times, you lose a point.
Each time you win or lose a point, the computer will think of a new letter.

Enjoy!
