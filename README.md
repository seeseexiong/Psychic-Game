# Psychic Game
This app is an interactive game that runs the web browswer.  
In this game, you have to guess what letter the computer is thinking about.
You can type any letter from 'a' through 'z' for each guess.
Each time you guess right you get a point.
If you guess wrong 9 times, you lose a point.
Each time you win or lose a point, the computer will think of a new letter.

Enjoy!
